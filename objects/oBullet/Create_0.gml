/*
Goals for bullet mechanic

	- Accuracy determines what hits & misses which creates
	an environment where bullets can fly overhead.
	
	- Cover counters Accuracy. Higher the cover, higher the accuracy
	needed to hit.
	
	- If accuracy is high enough, damage will be increased.

	- Accuracy affects how well it flys to target.
	
	- Bullets change shape depending on who shoots it.
	
	- Bullets have different damage values depending on target.
	
	- Bullets cant penetrate certain targets depending on shooter.
	
	- Bullets can break cover if accuracy and penetration is high enough
